# WebGL experiments

Each folder contains a different experiment created for a course.

1. First is a ball kicking on the floor. The number of the polygons that
form the balls change. The gravity can be changed either.
2. Second is a bird flying. There's also some flies. You can rotate the camera.
3. Third is a curve editor. You draw a curve and a surface and third 
object is created by combining them.
